# An Analysis of Green Stock Returns (2017-18)

## Overview of the Project
This project was created to assist Steve's parents with investing in green energy stocks. Initially, Steve's parents only wanted to invest in Daqo New Energy (DQ), but Steve was rightfully concerned that it might be smarter to diversify these funds throughout an array of green stocks. Therefore, I created this analysis to display the differences between the returns of 12 unique green stocks throughout 2017 and 2018. By creating code through VBA in Excel, I was able to compile data from these 12 stocks for total volume and the yearly return. Since Steve wanted to quickly and cleanly view these datasets, I created interactive buttons on this sheet for him to easily cycle between the outputs for 2017 and for 2018.
